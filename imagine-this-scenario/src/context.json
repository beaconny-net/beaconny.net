        "While walking down Main Street the other morning I noticed a couple of city workers walking ahead of me enter Mr. V's Deli. I've never been to Mr. V's Deli because I get the impression that they don't cater to my strict vegetarian diet, but I should maybe check it out anyway. Or maybe I shouldn't. Mr. V's doesn't have to be for me. They always look busy in the morning when I walk by, and I recognize many of their customers as long-time Beacon residents. It's seems like a great social scene, and I hear that the food's good. ![a photograph of the mister vs deli storefront](images/mister-vees-deli.jpg)",
        "If Mr. V's is as socially important as I suspect, our community should figure out how to ensure its continued existence."
