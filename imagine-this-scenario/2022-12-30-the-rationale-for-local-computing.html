          The Rationale for Local Computing

        <p>
          When I tell people that I'm building community-centric <a href="https://beaconny.net">websites and services</a> that run on computers in my basement, they sometimes ask "why not just use <em>[some existing service]</em> ?" I'll tell you why! All of the websites and online social networks that we depend on, e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, etc., run on computers that we don't control, that we access over networks that we also don't control. This means that anytime something goes wrong with the service or the network, we lose access to critical resources and tools. Let's break it down into categories.
        </p>
          <h3>  Dependability</h3>        <p>
          A best practice in software development is to minimize reliance on third-party dependencies, which may become unavailable, or be modified in such a way that it breaks your stuff, at any time without your knowledge or approval. If we agree that digital services provide critical capabilities for our community, then we should establish a local backup, or reimplementation, of these systems in the event that they become unavailable or unreliable in the future.

          <h3>  Empowerment</h3>          <figure><img src="images/knowledge-beaconny-net-server.jpg" alt="The Rapberry Pi that runs knowledge.beaconny.net" title="The Rapberry Pi that runs knowledge.beaconny.net"><figcaption>The Rapberry Pi that runs knowledge.beaconny.net</figcaption></figure>        <p>
          For most, the Internet is a thing that runs out there, in <em>The Cloud</em> &#8482;, on computers that they've never seen. But the dirty truth is that <em>The Cloud</em> &#8482 is just someone elses' computers, and anyone can plug their computer in to become part of the Internet too! For example, check out this photograph of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi</a> computer that runs the <a href="https://www.kiwix.org/en/">Kiwix</a> server at <a href="http://knowledge.beaconny.net">knowledge.beaconny.net</a>. Every time someone goes to that website, lights starting blinking in my basement - it's very exciting! I can make these computers do whatever I want, and you can too.
