          The Rationale for Local Computing
        </h2>
        <p>
          When I tell people that I'm running <a href="https://beaconny.net">beaconny.net</a> from computers in my basement, they usually ask "why?" - I'll tell you why!
        </p>
          <div style="clear: left;"></div>          <h3>  All the Fancy Services</h3>        <p>
          You know em, you love em, you can not live without them:
        </p>
          <img src="images/social-media-logos.png" alt="logos of the most popular online social networks" style="max-width: 100%; float: left; margin-right: 1rem;">        <p>
          But we're all just users of these services, with no control over, or visibility into, their operation, or any guarantees that they'll continue to work in the future. At any moment, any of these services could disappear and take all of its content and our social network with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a software engineering perspective, there's nothing special about these platforms - an experienced developer could whip up a passable clone of any of these in a week's time. The real value is in the fact that people have agreed to use them, and as the ol' adage goes: <q cite="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07/16/product/">If you are not paying for it, you’re not the customer; you’re the product being sold.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          While I'm not suggesting that we all abandon the Internet at large and vow to use only hand-crafted, artisanal, local digital services, for the reasons detailed below, we should do what we can to ensure that our community can continue to leverage the tools of technology, regardless of what the future may hold.
        </p>
          <h3>  Dependability</h3>          <figure><img src="images/knowledge-beaconny-net-server.jpg" alt="The Rapberry Pi that runs knowledge.beaconny.net" title="The Rapberry Pi that runs knowledge.beaconny.net"><figcaption>The Rapberry Pi that runs knowledge.beaconny.net</figcaption></figure>        <p>
          For most, the Internet is a thing that runs out there, in <em>The Cloud</em> &#8482;, on computers that they've never seen. But the dirty truth is that <em>The Cloud</em> &#8482 is just someone elses' computers, and anyone can make their computer part of the Internet. For example, check out this photo of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi</a> that runs the <a href="https://www.kiwix.org/en/">Kiwix</a> server at <a href="http://knowledge.beaconny.net">knowledge.beaconny.net</a>. Every time someone goes to that website, lights starting blinking in my basement - it's very exciting! Even if the Internet somehow disappeared, you could still walk over to my front yard, connect to my wifi access point, and read <a href="https://knowledge.beaconny.net/gutenberg_en_all_2022-10/A/Home.html">these 50,000+ ebooks</a>, or check out <a href="https://knowledge.beaconny.net/wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2022-05/A/Sloth">this wikipedia article on sloths</a>.

          <h3>  Ownership</h3>        <p>
          We should all have local backups of our important documents, photos, and videos. Check out this NYT article: <a href="https://archive.is/M3UPK">Your Memories. Their Cloud.</a>
