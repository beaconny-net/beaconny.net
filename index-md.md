## About

beaconny.net is maintained by members of the <a href="http://computing.beaconny.net">Beacon Computing Club</a> as a place for local digital content and as a platform for web technology education and experimentation.

## Forums

- [Computing Club](http://computing.beaconny.net)
  - Learn, share, discuss, and collaborate on all things computers, programming, and technology.

### Create your own forum!

Our discussion forums are powered by the free and open-source <a href="https://www.forem.com/">Forem</a> application.

If you'd like to start your own, get in touch at: <a href="mailto:admin@beaconny.net">admin@beaconny.net</a>

- We'll provide a free subdomain: **your-forum-name**`.beaconny.net`
- You'll host the application in your own [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) account (which we'll help you set up) at a cost of about $15/month.
- If you need support, you can ask for help in the great community over at the [official Forem site](https://forem.dev), or in our [Computing Club](http://computing.beaconny.net) forum.

Alternatively, Forem offers their own [cloud-hosted version](https://www.forem.com/get-started) that takes care of all the technical details and includes support, to which you can point a custom **your-forum-name**`.beaconny.net` subdomain.
