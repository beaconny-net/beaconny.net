### Abstract

This document outlines a proposed technology education and digital fabrication space in Beacon, NY, tentatively called the "Interface Research Lab".

### Mission

Create a welcoming and engaging physical space where community members can interact with, get inspired by, learn/teach about, and leverage the tools of computing, communication, and digital fabrication technologies.

### Location

This space will ideally be located on or close to Main St. in order to provide a central location for residents and high visibility to visitors.
Given the nature of the involved equipment (e.g. CNC router, laser cutter, etc.), the space should be primarily industrial; a former auto garage, firehouse, or under-utilized municipal building could be a good fit.

### Schedule

- Weekday mornings:
  - quiet co-working and community outreach
- Weekday afternoons
  - middle and/or high school students can gather to learn, build, share, and play with technology
- Weekday evenings
  - hold classes on computer programming, video game design, Linux and open-source software, and digital fabrication
  - host talks on technology, science, art, and philosophy
  - host music, visual, and interactive performances
- Weekends
  - open tool access for community members
  - retail sales of electronic and robotic components and finished goods designed and fabricated by community members
  - fun, interactive things for visitors to engage with
  - events

### Collateral Applications

#### Community Cloud

Provide cloud computing servers that can be accessed for free by the community to provide a local data center for learning, development, and hosting of digital community resources such as website hosting, forums, social networks, and media storage. The space will need access to a symmetrical, high-speed Internet connection.

#### Community Goods

Establish relationships with local businesses to showcase and sell locally-designed/fabricated goods, and to furnish these businesses with digital services and goods (e.g. wooden signs, lamps, accessories (e.g. condiment caddies), furniture).

#### Plastic Waste Recycling

Following the [Precious Plastic](http://preciousplastic.com/) model, collect and grind plastic waste for use with injection molding, extrusion, and sheet press machines to create useful new and replacement products. This effort would help develop a communal understanding of the process and benefits of recycling while eliminating material from the waste stream and facilitating a sense of shared contribution and investment.

#### Emergency Response / PPE

The digital services and fabrication capabilities can be used to produce protective equipment and other necessary resources in times of need.

### Potential library focus

Libraries are a critical community resource ...
