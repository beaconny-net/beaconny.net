### Abstract

This document outlines a proposed technology education and digital fabrication space in Beacon, NY, tentatively called the "Interface Research Lab".

### Mission

Create a welcoming and engaging physical space where community members can interact with, get inspired by, learn/teach about, and leverage the tools of computing, communication, and digital fabrication technologies.

### Location

This space will ideally be located on or close to Main St. in order to provide a central location for residents and high visibility to visitors.
Given the nature of the involved equipment (e.g. CNC router, laser cutter, etc.), the space should be primarily industrial; a former auto garage, firehouse, or under-utilized municipal building could be a good fit.

### Schedule

- Weekday mornings:
  - quiet co-working and community outreach
- Weekday afternoons
  - middle and/or high school students can gather to learn, build, share, and play with technology
- Weekday evenings
  - hold classes on computer programming, video game design, Linux and open-source software, and digital fabrication
  - host talks on technology, science, art, and philosophy
  - host music, visual, and interactive performances
- Weekends
  - open tool access for community members
  - retail sales of electronic and robotic components and finished goods designed and fabricated by community members
  - fun, interactive things for visitors to engage with
  - events

### Collateral Applications

#### Community Cloud

Provide cloud computing servers that can be accessed for free by the community to provide a local data center for learning, development, and hosting of digital community resources such as website hosting, forums, social networks, and media storage. This this end, it would be beneficial to have access to a symmetrical, high-speed Internet connection.

#### Emergency Response / PPE

The flexible fabrication capabilities can be used to produce protective equipment and other necessary resources in times of need.
